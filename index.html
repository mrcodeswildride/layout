    <div id="box1" class="box">
        <p>This is box 1.</p>
        <p>Inspect this box to see the HTML for the boxes. Each box is made with a div tag.</p>
        <p>In the inspector, look at the styles for the box. Both box1 and box2 have a display: inline-block style, which puts the boxes side by side.</p>
        <p>Both box1 and box2 have a vertical-align: top style, which makes the top of the boxes line up with each other.</p>
        <p>Box1 has both padding and margin styles. In the inspector, uncheck those styles and observe what happens.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="box2" class="box">
        <p>This is box 2.</p>

        <div id="box3" class="box">
            <p>This is box 3, which is inside box 2.</p>
            <p>It has both padding and margin styles.</p>

            <p>This is box 4, which is inside box 2.</p>
