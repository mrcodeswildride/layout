    <h1>Layout</h1>

    <div id="box1">
      <p>box1</p>

      <p>
        Open the inspector by right clicking anywhere in this box, and clicking Inspect at the
        bottom of the menu.
      </p>

      <p>In the inspector, click box1. It is made with a div tag.</p>

      <p>
        In the inspector, look at the styles for this box. It has a width, height, and border. Those
        styles are needed to make a box.
      </p>

      <p>
        This box also has padding and margin styles. In the inspector, uncheck those styles and
        observe what happens.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="box2">
      <p>box2</p>

      <p>
        In the inspector, look at the styles for this box. Both box1 and box2 have a display:
        inline-block style, which puts the boxes side by side. Uncheck that style and observe what
        happens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both box1 and box2 have a vertical-align: top style, which makes the top of the boxes line
        up with each other. Uncheck that style and observe what happens.
